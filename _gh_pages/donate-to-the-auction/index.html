			<h2 class="txt-inherit" style="color: #447042">About Us</h2>
			<p>The Down on the Farm Gala is an annual event that is used as a tool to raise money for local non-profits that serve our community. Our goal at each event is to raise $100,000 and have a fun time doing it. The gala is funded such that all money raised can be donated to the organization being promoted.</p>
			<p>The concept started as a dream in 2019 when our family purchased a farmette outside of Brooklyn. The property the event is hosted on has a rich history of farming and family that goes back to 1870. From the onset, we envisioned this to be a blessing for not just our family but our community as well.</p>

			<h2 class="txt-inherit" style="color: #447042">The Cause</h2>
			<p>Badger Prairie Needs Network (BPNN) operates one of the busiest food pantries in Dane County, Wisconsin. In 2020, we served over 24,000 individuals from throughout Dane County, WI. Food insecurity is real for too many in our community. Odds are, you may know of someone who needs help from organizations like BPNN, especially in light of high unemployment, low wages or bridging an unexpected expense. </p>
			<p> While their operations have shifted from in pantry shopping to curbside pickup, our values at the core are unwavering. Our service area includes all of Dane County and guests may visit BPNN twice monthly. </p>
			<p>We are 100% volunteer - all funds raised go toward our mission and keeping the lights on. </p>
